# Awesome Bitcoin Payment Processors [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome Bitcoin payment processors enabling merchants, businesses and nonprofits to accept Bitcoin payments.

Why are they awesome?

1. They are either immune to financial censorship or they don't practice it.
2. They accept Bitcoin via native Bitcoin addresses and don't require wallets to use the [controversial payment protocol](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/169222582782/bitpay-qr-codes-are-no-longer-valid-important).
3. They don't [block payments by IPs/locations](https://twitter.com/alex_kaul/status/1090211252331208705).

## Self-Hosted Bitcoin Payment Processors

Self-Hosted payment processors run on your server and provide you with a full control over the entire payment process and funds. There's no third-party involvement - that significantly increases the censorship-resistance, privacy, and security for you and your customers.
