## Self-Hosted Payment Processors

Self-Hosted payment processors run on your server and provide you with a full control over the entire payment process and funds. There's no third-party involvement - that significantly increases the censorship-resistance, privacy, and security for you and your customers.

## Hosted Payment Processors

Hosted payment processors run on someone else's server. This simplifies the initial setup process, but reduces the amount of control you have over the payment process and even funds, if they use their wallets for receiving payments.
